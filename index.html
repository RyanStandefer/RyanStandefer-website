        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello my name is Ryan Standefer and this is the website I had to create for my cs8 class. I am a third year biology major who is planning on applying to medical school after I graduate. In my free time I like to workout, play video games, and hangout with my friends. I enjoy taking this class but it is definitely a lot of work and I have no idea how I am going to fill this with 500 words. <br><br>

        I have lived in Riverside county all my life and one thing I have greatly noticed that I would like to change is the disparity of health education and access to healthcare throughout the county. I have seen many cities in the county where most people do not have access to healthcare as it is seen as a luxury instead of a necessity and this is something that I am very invested in changing. No one should have to suffer with chronic health issues when there is treatment that can either cure or greatly reduce symptoms and it is a shame that these treatments are simply too expensive for these individuals to afford. I want to become a physician because I want to be able to give my time and expertise to help out the people in these underserved communities and help them live fundamentally healthier lives that they will be able to enjoy more. After I become a Physician I hope to open a free clinic that focuses on mental health awareness and education, living an active lifestyle and nutrition training, as well as general public health issues. I hope that with this clinic I will be able to help fight the stigma that comes with mental health issues and help individuals who have been neglected by the healthcare system overcome their challenges. I believe that in our current healthcare system mental health is always put on the back burner and is treated reactively instead of proactively, and especially in those who are underserved they may not receive help until it is either too late or almost too late. I also believe that many of our communities issues are due to poor nutrition and physical inactivity and much of this has to do with lack of education on these topics so, if they were able to have a trusted clinic in the community they would be more willing to learn about these topics and make lifestyle changes that will benefit them in every aspect of their life.

        Thank you for coming by to read my bio
